# Optional Commands

# Send captured ITM to the file itm.fifo
# (the microcontroller SWO pin must be connected to the programmer SWO pin)
# 8000000 must match the core clock frequency:
# monitor tpiu config internal itm.fifo uart off 8000000

# OR: make the microcontroller SWO pin output compatible with UART (8N1)
# 2000000 is the frequency of the SWO pin:
# monitor tpiu config external uart off 8000000 2000000

# Enable ITM port 0:
# monitor itm port 0 on
